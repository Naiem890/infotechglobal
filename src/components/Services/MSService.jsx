      </h2>
      <h5 className="text-lg font-poppins font-bold mb-6">
        Mobile Apps, the Internet of Things (IoT) and "comfortable computing"
        are primed to dominate the industry year on year.
      </h5>
      <div className="mb-8 leading-7">
        In today’s sophisticated world, there is a great demand for secure and

        to its customers on a variety of platforms and devices ranging from iOS,
        Windows, Android, HTML5, and many more. Our latest, cost-effective, good

      <h3 className="text-[28px] font-poppins font-bold mb-6">Challenges</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside leading-7 mb-8">
        <li>
          This is generally the biggest concern for businesses when it comes to
          deploying an enterprise mobility solution. While Bring Your Own Device
          (BYOD) has brought so many benefits for businesses, including the
          likes of increased productivity and cost saving, it has also brought
          with it many security challenges.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adopting a BYOD strategy can lead to security risks, especially among
          enterprise CIO’s. Keeping sensitive corporate information secure is
          critical and therefore you can’t be too careful when it comes to BYOD.
        </li>
        <li>
          This is where enterprise mobility management solutions come in -
          harnessing desktop and app virtualization can ensure all business
          information is where it should be - in the data centre - accessed by
          the people that need to access it, and not stored on an endpoint
          device that could get misplaced on the tube or stolen from a handbag.
        </li>
        <li>
          A good MAM (Mobile Application Management) solution will offer your
          enterprise flexibility and your IT department to apply different
          policies for different applications, user types and mobility
          scenarios.
        </li>
        <li>Providing Mobile Data Access</li>
        <TLi>
          It’s one thing mobilizing your workforce, however, employees need to
          be able to access company data on the go in order to make quick and
          decisive decisions.
        </TLi>
        <TLi>
          Employees need access to the data that’s available in the office. Live
          data access from mobile devices will ensure your business and
          employees remain effective and efficient.
        </TLi>
        <TLi>
          But once again, this does present some more security concerns.
          Enterprises must enable users to easily share data inside and outside
          the business with secure file sharing that’s integrated with backup.
        </TLi>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="text-[28px] font-poppins font-bold mb-6">
        App Distribution
      </h3>
      <ul className="mb-8">
        <TLi>
          Making enterprise apps easily accessible can be quite complicated,
          from installing directly to each device to providing employees and
          users with tools to install themselves. This has created issues with
          managing UDID (Unique Device Identification) numbers to changing
          devices and more common BYOD policies.
        </TLi>
        <TLi>
          More and more often, businesses are employing MAM services to manage
          app accessibility for users and the security of the content within the
          apps. Distribution needs to be thought through thoroughly to ensure
          all users have access to the app when required. Some enterprise
          applications can even be deployed on the consumer store, but be aware
          as anybody can then utilize the app. Therefore a suitable login
          process needs to be implemented.
        </TLi>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="text-[28px] font-poppins font-bold mb-6">
        Multi-Platform Mobile App Development & Testing
      </h3>
      <ul className="mb-8">
        <TLi>
          In today's BYOD world, one of the major hurdles to mobility cited by
          IT professionals is around multi-platform mobile app development and
          testing. Hence mobile application development backlogs continue to
          grow, impacting employee productivity, customer service and
          competiveness while key business initiatives continue to be delayed or
          abandoned altogether.
        </TLi>
        <TLi>
          The reason why there is such a chasm between demand for mobile apps
          and ability to deliver is the shortage of skilled resources that
          code-based development demands, particularly when it comes to
          supporting multiple mobile platforms and devices.
        </TLi>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="text-[28px] font-poppins font-bold mb-6">
        Keeping Up with Technology
      </h3>
      <ul className="mb-8">
        <TLi>
          Once you've got your application up and running, the ongoing process
          of running it will throw up additional problems.
        </TLi>
        <TLi>
          Poor performance and speed are deal-breakers for a company when it
          comes to their enterprise apps. While some businesses would argue that
          part of this lies out of their hands - as the strength of data
          networks is of course not their responsibility - it will fall to them
          to develop apps that fulfil employees' requirements for functionality
          without being so clunky as to always require above average network
          connectivity to work.
        </TLi>
        <TLi>
          This may extend to providing users with some offline functionality or
          background synchronization options in instances when network
          performance is lacking.
        </TLi>
        <TLi>
          By abstracting back-end functions in the cloud, businesses can free up
          their resources to simultaneously focus on front-end development and
          develop strong mobile business models.
